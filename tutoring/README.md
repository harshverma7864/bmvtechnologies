I have masked the url using bit.ly because I don't have any domain to redirect it.

For masking we must need an IP or a subdomain.

If have used react for front end and Node JS for backend using fetch api and express.


// Please install node modules using 
cd ./backend
npm init 
npm install node
nodemon ./index.js

cd ..
npm start
 
backend server will start at localhost:5000
front end react server will start at localhost:3000
 
select the time slots and click book now 
 
Now check the console

If you will check the console then u can see the all 6 urls.![Screenshot (68)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83391423/166048524-73f0a1a2-22a6-4360-be39-42c15813d602.png)
